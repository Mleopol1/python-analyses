# Python Analyses

This repository contains two Python scripts: one for analyzing financial records in PyBank and one for analyzing election results in PyPoll.

## PyBank

The PyBank script analyzes a sample financial dataset called budget_data.csv, which is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The script calculates the following values:

   * The total number of months included in the dataset
   * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
   * The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
   * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
   * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Additionally, the PyBank script prints the analysis to both the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

The PyPoll script analyzes a sample poll dataset called election_data.csv, which is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The script calculates the following values:

   * The total number of votes cast
   * A complete list of candidates who received votes
   * The percentage of votes each candidate won
   * The total number of votes each candidate won
   * The winner of the election based on popular vote

Additionally, the PyPoll script prints the analysis to both the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
